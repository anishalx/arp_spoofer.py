## Overview

**GhostARP** is a powerful yet lightweight ARP spoofing tool, engineered for penetration testers, cybersecurity professionals, and ethical hackers. Designed with efficiency in mind, GhostARP allows users to conduct ARP spoofing attacks with minimal network disruption, enabling detailed traffic analysis and network vulnerability assessments.

By mimicking legitimate ARP packets, GhostARP allows you to reroute network traffic between the target and gateway, effectively performing **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)** attacks. Whether for educational purposes or professional security assessments, GhostARP ensures the integrity of your tests by restoring ARP tables once the operation is terminated.

## Key Features

- **Stealth Mode**: Operates with minimal packet flooding to avoid detection.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple and intuitive command-line interface for quick usage.
- **Auto ARP Restoration**: Automatically resets ARP tables after interruption or shutdown.
- **Real-Time Packet Count**: Displays the number of spoofed packets sent during operation.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable for various network configurations and scenarios.
  
## Installation

### Requirements
Ensure the following dependencies are installed:
- Python 3.x
- Scapy (for crafting and sending ARP packets)
- colorama library

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anishalx/ghostarp.git
   cd ghostarp
   ```
   
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install scapy colorama
   ```
   
3. Run the tool:
   ```bash
   python ghostarp.py
   ```

   ## Usage
   After installation, GhostARP can be executed from the terminal. The tool will prompt you for the Target IP and Gateway IP to initiate the ARP spoofing process.

1. **Run the Tool**

   Execute the script with the following command:

   ```bash
   python ghostarp.py
   ```
2. **Input Required Information**
   
    - You will be prompted to enter the target IP address.
    - Enter the IP address of the gateway.

Ensure that both IPs are valid and reachable on your network.

3. **Start Spoofing**
   
   The tool will start sending spoofed ARP packets. You will see the count of packets sent in real-time.

4. **Stopping the Tool**
   
   To stop the tool, press Ctrl + C. The tool will automatically restore the ARP tables for both the target and the gateway.
